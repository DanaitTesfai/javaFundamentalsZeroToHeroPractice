1.  Print all elements of an array
   Question:
   Given an array {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}, print each element.

-----------------------------------------------

2. Sum of elements in an array

4. A teacher wants to store the marks of 3 students in 3 subjects
(Math, Science, English). Use a 2D array to store and display the marks.

   0   1   2
0  85  90  78
1  68  97  82
2  90  61  89


marks[0][1]-----> 90
marks[2][2]-----> 89

int[][] marks = {{85,90,78}, {68,97,82}, {90,61,89}};
----------------------------------------------------------
5. Student Marks with Scanner

   Scenario:
   A teacher wants to store marks of 2 students in 3 subjects using
    a 2D array.
   The marks should be entered by the user, and then displayed in
   a table format.

   Hint:
   We can declare 2 by 3 2D array as follows
    int[][] marks = new int[2][3];
       0  1  2
    0  0  0  0
    1  0  0  0

   Enter marks for Student 1:
   Subject 1: 80
   Subject 2: 90
   Subject 3: 85
   Enter marks for Student 2:
   Subject 1: 70
   Subject 2: 75
   Subject 3: 80

   Student Marks Table:
   Student 1: 80 90 85
   Student 2: 70 75 80

------------------------------------------------------------------
6.Interactive Student Marks System
  Scenario:
  A teacher wants to manage student marks in a flexible way.
  The program should:

  Ask how many students are in the class.

  Ask how many subjects each student has.

  Accept each studentâ€™s name and marks for all subjects.

  Calculate the total and average marks for each student.

  Print a tabular report.

  Display the topper (highest average)

  Enter number of students: 2
  Enter number of subjects: 3

  Enter name for Student 1: Alice
  Enter marks for Alice:
  Subject 1: 85
  Subject 2: 90
  Subject 3: 80

  Enter name for Student 2: Bob
  Enter marks for Bob:
  Subject 1: 70
  Subject 2: 75
  Subject 3: 65

  Student Marks Report:
  Name    Sub1    Sub2    Sub3    Total   Average
  Alice   85      90      80      255     85.0
  Bob     70      75      65      210     70.0

  Topper: Alice with average = 85.0


  Hint:
   numberOfStudents = 2
   numberOfSubjects = 3
   String[] names = new String[numberOfStudents];
   int[][] marks = new int[numberOfStudents][numberOfSubjects];

   double[] total = new double[numberOfStudents];

   names = [null, null]
   marks = [{0,0,0}, {0,0,0}]
   total = {0.0, 0.0}
