1. Hotel Billing System (with Casting and String Methods)
Scenario (Instruction to Student):
A hotel wants to build a simple program to generate a bill for its guests.
The system should collect the guest’s name, number of nights, and nightly rate.
It then calculates the total cost and shows it in uppercase, using string methods
and basic casting.

   Output Example:

=== Hotel Billing System ===
Enter guest name: Marta
Enter number of nights: 3
Enter price per night: 49.99

--- BILL SUMMARY ---
Customer: MARTA
Nights: 3
Nightly Rate: $49.99
Total amount: $149.97

2. Car Rental – Using Type Casting
Scenario:
A car rental company wants a small program that calculates how much a customer
should pay based on rental days and daily rate.
The company stores the base rate as an int but wants the final result
 as a double using automatic casting.

  Output Example:

=== Car Rental Invoice Generator ===
Enter customer name: Nahom
Enter number of rental days: 4
Enter daily rental rate (whole number): 60

----- Invoice -----
Customer Name: NAHOM
Days Rented: 4
Daily Rate: $60
Total Amount Due: $240.0
