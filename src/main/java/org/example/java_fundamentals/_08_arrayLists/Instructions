1.Product Inventory System
Question:
Create a Product class with:

productId (int)

productName (String)

price (double)

Create an ArrayList<Product> and add 5 products.

Print all product details using an enhanced for loop.

Ask the user to enter a product name and search for it.

If found, print the product details, else print "Product not found!".

2.Problem: Manage a Library of Books
  Question:
  Create a Java program to manage a small library system where you can
  store books, display them, and search for a specific book by its title.

  Requirements:

  Create a Book class with the following:

  bookId (int) – represents the unique ID of the book.

  title (String) – represents the title of the book.

  author (String) – represents the author of the book.

  A constructor to initialize these fields.

  A toString() method to display book details in this format:
   ID: 101, Title: "Java Basics", Author: "John Smith"

  In the main method (inside a separate class, e.g., LibraryApp):

  Create an ArrayList<Book> to store multiple books.

  Add at least 5 books to the list.

  Display all books:

  First, use a traditional for loop to display all books.

  Then, use an enhanced for loop to display all books again.


  Search for a book by title:

  Prompt the user to enter a book title.

  Use an enhanced for loop to search through the list.

  If the book is found, display its details: Book with title "Java Basics" found: ID: 101, Author: John Smith


    If the book is not found, display:   Book not found in the library.

    Expected Program Flow Example:
  All Books (Traditional For Loop):
  ID: 101, Title: "Java Basics", Author: "John Smith"
  ID: 102, Title: "Data Structures", Author: "Alice Johnson"
  ID: 103, Title: "Spring Boot Essentials", Author: "Michael Brown"
  ID: 104, Title: "Clean Code", Author: "Robert Martin"
  ID: 105, Title: "Algorithms in Java", Author: "Thomas Cormen"

  All Books (Enhanced For Loop):
  ID: 101, Title: "Java Basics", Author: "John Smith"
  ID: 102, Title: "Data Structures", Author: "Alice Johnson"
  ID: 103, Title: "Spring Boot Essentials", Author: "Michael Brown"
  ID: 104, Title: "Clean Code", Author: "Robert Martin"
  ID: 105, Title: "Algorithms in Java", Author: "Thomas Cormen"

  Enter a book title to search: Clean Code
  Book with title "Clean Code" found: ID: 104, Author: Robert Martin
